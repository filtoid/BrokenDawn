BrokenDawn
==========

A turn based, hex-tile based strategy game.

The server is designed to run on a Linux system (initially only Debian support but hopefully expand to all flavours).

The server processing will be done via a C++ program running as a process on the server. The clients will interact with the server via an Erlang based RESTful API (in YAWS). 

Details on how to set all that up to follow...
